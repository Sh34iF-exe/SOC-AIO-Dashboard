# SOC-AIO-Dashboard

> Enterprise-Grade Security Operations Center (SOC) Dashboard built using Cortex XSIAM and Splunk

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**SOC-AIO-Dashboard** is a centralized SOC monitoring solution designed to provide real-time visibility into security events, alerts, and incidents across enterprise environments.

The dashboard was developed using:

- <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsiam">Cortex XSIAM</a>  
- <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>  

This project demonstrates hands-on experience in security monitoring, alert correlation, detection engineering, and SOC operations workflows.
